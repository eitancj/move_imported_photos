## ISN'T BEING MAINTAINED
### Haven't properly reviewed this shell script in a while.  
### Still, you're welcome to give it a go.  
    
     
    
On MacOS X, after you've imported some pictures/videos using the Photos app,  
move the imported content of the app's hidden directory  
to an organized one on your desktop.

The script should display the total size of the files to be moved,  
and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

A new folder named after the current date will be created on your Desktop,  
where the imported files will be moved.  

The user running the script should have sufficient permissions to create the directory and such.  
Sudo is also an option.
